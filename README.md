# powa-pub

At [https://powa.be](https://powa.be), we are on a mission to make electricity
costs transparent. 

This starts by publishing data sources used in the costs calculations. These are:

- Types of costs
- Electricity providers
- Electricity provider contracts
- Electricity provider contract rates
- Electricity distributors
- Electricity distributor rates

By having the data of you provider and distributor published on powa-pub, you can 
make sure: 
- that you can use this data on [https://powa.be](https://powa.be)
- that this data can be verified by the community
